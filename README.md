# Design
## Colour Scheme
This site has been created on two main colors, **brown and white**, because they are directly and fundamentally related to all the recipes published on the site, and these two colors have been relied upon for several reasons including:

    1. It is comfortable for the eye, which attracts the visitor to browse the site with a strong desire.
    2. It is inspired by the color of chocolate, which is mainly used in most recipes, especially sweets. 
    3. Finally, it has to do with the loco that was placed at the top of the page.

As for the **orange** color that was added at the end of the pages in the foot, which is to increase the aesthetics of the site.

We have used two other colors in the buttons, which are the **green color** to allow & add something, and the **red color** to alert in the event of deleting or erasing something.

### The color palette is:
  - #683b12
  - #fff
  - #00c853
  - #b71c1c

## Typography
  - **Roboto font**: Is the main font used throughout the site with **Sans Serif** as the backup font In case the font isn't imported properly into the site for any reason from the google fonts, this font that I've used on all my pages is nice and clean font that's frequently used in programming, so it's attractive and appropriate.
  - The source for the inspired font is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
